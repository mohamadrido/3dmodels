<p><a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://free3dmodels.xyz/">Free 3D Models</a> is the place to share 3D Models under <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0">Public Domain</a> and <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0">CC0</a> License.<!--The website you are previewing is a mirror from cc03ds.com (formerly CC0 3DS).--> The reason do migration from <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a> that is can not freely write more the UI/UX. Obviously it is now fully Open Source under <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/publicdomainmodels/project/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a> and hosted on <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://github.com">Github</a>. You can get access to server-side code and be allowed to know how the website operates.</p>
<p>The 3D Models that created are currently from the minimum system requirements and from the basic shapes (low poly) without being encrypted, so you can choose <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons</a> by you and use it however. If you are expect 3D Models that includes a lot of assets, maybe will make it a few parts when itâ€™s published. These 3D Models are shared with priority to be able to see the results of the sample rendering with minimum system requirements, although I can create more detailed 3D models and then use render farm to see the results.</p>
